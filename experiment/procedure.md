#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. In simulation window front, top view and free-body diagram of Proell governor is displayed.<br>

2. Speed control pointer is given on top left of the screen, respective height is displayed below it and on the bottom left one checkbox for the graph is available.<br>

3. Move the slider knob to the right, this causes the rotational speed to change from 100 to 150 rpm.<br>

5. When graph checkbox is checked, a graph and theoretical correlation is displayed. This graph shows the trend of governor height on varying the rotational speed of governor. <br>
